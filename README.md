# Code-Profiller-Tool
Small tool with some example c files that can be ran and profiled semi-automatically.

Requires PAPI to run

The original functional code for each example with no instrumentation added is available inside the folder, Raw Code Examples.

CodeExampleDetails.ods contains a small description of the problem created by each code, and how it was fixed, 
along with performance counter data taken while executing the code in my machine (Intel Skylake).

Interfacing_Unfinished contains code examples that are still a work in progress.
