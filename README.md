# Code-Profiller-Tool
Small tool with some example c files that can be ran and profiled semi-automatically.

Requires PAPI to run.

The instrumented code to get performance data from is available inside the folder, CodeExamples.

The original functional code for each example with no instrumentation added is available inside the folder, RawCodeExamples.

CodeExampleDetails.ods contains a small description of the problem created by each code, and how it was fixed, 
along with performance counter data taken while executing the code in my machine (Intel Skylake).

Interfacing_Unfinished contains code examples that are still a work in progress.
